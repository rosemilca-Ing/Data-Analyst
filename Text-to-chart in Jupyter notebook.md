# **Use natural language to create charts and graphs**


Estimated time needed: **30** minutes


## Overview


Imagine you are a data analyst or a data scientist of a marketing team at an e-commerce company. The company needs to understand customer purchasing behaviors over the last year to tailor their upcoming holiday campaigns. Traditionally, this would involve complex SQL queries, data wrangling in Python, and perhaps building visual dashboards to interpret the results including analyzing spreadsheets, creating charts, and maybe even some statistical analysis—tasks that require considerable time and expertise.

With the integration of Langchain and LLMs, you can simply ask, "Show me a visualization of monthly sales trends by product category," or "Generate a heatmap of customer activity by region." The system would use the `create_pandas_dataframe_agent` to process the CSV data, and then dynamically generate visualizations such as line graphs, bar charts, or heatmaps in response to these queries. This not only speeds up the data analysis process but also allows team members who may not be tech-savvy to engage directly with the data and make informed decisions quickly. This approach fosters a more collaborative environment and ensures that strategic decisions are backed by real-time data insights, visually represented for easy comprehension.

In this lab, you will learn how to seamlessly integrate data visualization into your conversational data analysis using Langchain and LLMs. Starting with CSV file data, you will use the `create_pandas_dataframe_agent` to build an interactive agent that not only understands and responds to your queries but also translates data responses into visual formats. You will explore how to dynamically generate charts, graphs, and heatmaps directly in response to natural language questions. This capability will enable you to visualize trends, compare figures, and spot patterns immediately, making your data analysis workflow both efficient and visually engaging. By the end of this project, you will have the skills to create a data conversational agent that acts as both analyst and visualizer, bringing data to life through dialogue.

In this lab we are going to use Llama 3.3 LLM hosted on the IBM watsonx.ai platform.

## Objectives


After completing the project, you should be able to:

- **Use Langchain with large language models**: Understand and apply the Langchain framework in conjunction with LLMs to interact with and analyze data stored in CSV files through natural language processing.
- **Create conversational data agents**: Build a conversational agent that can understand and respond to natural language queries about data, enabling users to ask questions directly and receive immediate answers.
- **Implement data visualization through dialogue**: Integrate data visualization tools within your conversational agent, allowing you to request and generate visual data representations such as graphs, charts, and heatmaps dynamically based on your queries.
- **Enhance decision-making process**: Develop the capability to derive actionable insights from data via interactive dialogues and visual outputs, thereby improving the decision-making process and making data analysis accessible to non-technical stakeholders.

## Setup


This project is based on Jupyter Notebook. If you're not familiar with it, here's a quick guide on how to run code within it:

A Jupyter Notebook consists of cells. To execute a code cell, click on the cell that you want to run and click the 'Run' button, as shown in the picture.


<img src="https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IwbhiH3Wwv-VK-J4rioTAw/run.png" width="50%" alt="indexing"/>


For this lab, we will be using the following libraries:

*   [`ibm-watson-ai`](https://ibm.github.io/watson-machine-learning-sdk/index.html) for using LLMs from IBM's watsonx.ai.
*   [`LangChain`, `langchain-ibm`, `langchain-experimental`](https://www.langchain.com/) for using its agent function to interact with data.
*   [`matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMML0187ENSkillsNetwork31430127-2021-01-01) for additional plotting tools.
*   [`seaborn`](https://seaborn.pydata.org/?utm_medium=Exinfluencer&utm_source=Exinfluencer&utm_content=000026UJ&utm_term=10006555&utm_id=NA-SkillsNetwork-Channel-SkillsNetworkCoursesIBMML0187ENSkillsNetwork31430127-2021-01-01) for visualizing the data.


### Installing required libraries

The following required libraries are __not__ preinstalled in the Skills Network Labs environment. __You must run the following cell__ to install them:

**Note:** We are pinning the version here to specify the version. It's recommended that you do this as well. Even if the library is updated in the future, the installed library could still support this lab work.

This might take approximately 1-2 minutes. 

As we use `%%capture` to capture the installation, you won't see the output process. But after the installation completes, you will see a number beside the cell.



```python
%%capture
!pip install ibm-watsonx-ai=="0.2.6"
!pip install --user langchain=="0.1.16" 
!pip install --user langchain-ibm=="0.1.4"
!pip install --user langchain-experimental=="0.0.57"
!pip install matplotlib=="3.8.4"
!pip install seaborn=="0.13.2"
```

After you installat the libraries, restart your kernel. You can do that by clicking the **Restart the kernel** icon.

### Importing required libraries

_We recommend you import all required libraries in one place (here):_



```python
# We use this section to suppress warnings generated by your code:
def warn(*args, **kwargs):
    pass
import warnings
warnings.warn = warn
warnings.filterwarnings('ignore')

from ibm_watsonx_ai.foundation_models import Model
from ibm_watsonx_ai.metanames import GenTextParamsMetaNames as GenParams
from ibm_watson_machine_learning.foundation_models.extensions.langchain import WatsonxLLM

from langchain_experimental.agents.agent_toolkits import create_pandas_dataframe_agent

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import pandas as pd
```

## Data set


In this lab, you will work on the Student Alcohol Consumption data set `student-mat.csv` by UCI Machine Learning as an example. For more information, see [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/student-alcohol-consumption). It is based on data collected from two secondary schools in Portugal. The students included in the survey were in mathematics and Portuguese courses.


The data set we are using is for the mathematics course. The number of mathematics students involved in the collection was 395. The data collected in locations such as Gabriel Pereira and Mousinho da Silveira includes several pertinence values. Examples of such data are records of demographic information, grades, and alcohol consumption.

### Load the data set


Execute the code in the following cell to load your dataset. This code reads the CSV file into a pandas DataFrame, making the data accessible for processing in Python.



```python
df = pd.read_csv(
    "https://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/ZNoKMJ9rssJn-QbJ49kOzA/student-mat.csv"
)
```

## Load LLM


Execute the code in the cell below to load the llama-3-3-70b LLM model from watsonx.ai. 

Additionally, we will configure the LLM to interact with data by integrating it with Langchain's `create_pandas_dataframe_agent`.



```python
# Create a dictionary to store credential information
credentials = {
    "url"    : "https://us-south.ml.cloud.ibm.com"
}

# Indicate the model we would like to initialize. In this case, Llama 3 70B.
model_id    = 'meta-llama/llama-3-3-70b-instruct'

# Initialize some watsonx.ai model parameters
params = {
        GenParams.MAX_NEW_TOKENS: 256, # The maximum number of tokens that the model can generate in a single run.
        GenParams.TEMPERATURE: 0,   # A parameter that controls the randomness of the token generation. A lower value makes the generation more deterministic, while a higher value introduces more randomness.
    }
project_id  = "skills-network" # <--- NOTE: specify "skills-network" as your project_id
space_id    = None
verify      = False

# Launch a watsonx.ai model
model = Model(
    model_id=model_id, 
    credentials=credentials, 
    params=params, 
    project_id=project_id, 
    space_id=space_id, 
    verify=verify
)

# Integrate the watsonx.ai model with the langchain framework
llm = WatsonxLLM(model = model)

agent = create_pandas_dataframe_agent(
    llm,
    df,
    verbose=False,
    return_intermediate_steps=True  # set return_intermediate_steps=True so that model could return code that it comes up with to generate the chart
)
```

### Interact with your data


Let's start with a simple interaction.

Ask LLM how many rows of data are in the CSV file.



```python
response = agent.invoke("how many rows of data are in this file?")
```


```python
response['output']
```




    'There are 395 rows of data in this file.'



From the output above, the model reports that there are 395 rows of data in the file.


Let's verify this count using Python code to ensure accuracy.



```python
len(df)
```




    395



The row count matches and is correct! 


Curious about the code the LLM generated and used to create this result?

Run the code in the cell below to reveal the underlying commands.



```python
response['intermediate_steps'][-1][0].tool_input.replace('; ', '\n')
```




    'len(df)'



Surprisingly, the LLM uses the same code as we do.


Also, we could let LLM return some data that we are looking for based on the CSV file.



```python
response = agent.invoke("Give me all the data where student's age is over 18 years old.")
```


```python

    394     3     3       5         5   8   9   9  )]}


Let's get the code LLM used for charting this plot.



```python
response['intermediate_steps'][-1][0].tool_input.replace('; ', '\n')
```




    "df[df['age'] > 18]"



### Plot your data with natural language


#### Task 1
Generating a first visual on the data set to know the total number of male and female students in the data set.

We just tell the agent that "Plot the gender count with bars."



```python
response = agent.invoke("Plot the gender count with bars.")
```


    
![png](output_51_0.png)
    


Let's see what code the LLM generated for ploting this chart.



```python
print(response['intermediate_steps'][-1][0].tool_input.replace('; ', '\n'))
```

    ```python
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    gender_counts = df['sex'].value_counts()
    plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
    plt.bar(gender_counts.index, gender_counts.values)
    plt.xlabel('Sex')
    plt.ylabel('Count')
    plt.title('Gender Count')
    plt.show()
    ```


#### Task 2

Generating a pie chart for displaying the average value of weekend alcohol for each gender in the data set.

We will use the prompt "Generate a pie chart to display average value of Walc for each gender."

You may notice that the model generates two charts. The charts actually indicate the progressive improvement of the agent's code as it searches for the best way to answer to our prompt. It presents an improvement in the response to our query.



```python
response = agent.invoke("Generate a pie chart to display average value of Walc for each Gender.")
```


    
![png](output_55_0.png)
    


Let's get the code LLM used for charting this plot.



```python
print(response['intermediate_steps'][-1][0].tool_input.replace('; ', '\n'))
```

    ```python
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    # Group by sex and calculate the average of Walc
    average_Walc = df.groupby('sex')['Walc'].mean()
    
    # Create a pie chart
    plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
    plt.pie(average_Walc, labels = average_Walc.index, autopct='%1.1f%%')
    plt.title('Average Walc by Gender')
    plt.show()
    ```


#### Task 3

We can explore the impact of free time on grades based on the data.



```python
response = agent.invoke("Create box plots to analyze the relationship between 'freetime' (amount of free time) and 'G3' (final grade) across different levels of free time.")
```


    
![png](output_59_0.png)
    


Execute the code below to retrieve the Python script the LLM used for plotting.



```python
print(response['intermediate_steps'][-1][0].tool_input.replace('; ', '\n'))
```

    ```python
    import pandas as pd
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    # Assuming df is the DataFrame
    plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
    plt.boxplot([df.loc[df['freetime'] == 2, 'G3'], df.loc[df['freetime'] == 3, 'G3'], df.loc[df['freetime'] == 4, 'G3']], labels=['Low', 'Medium', 'High'])
    plt.title('Boxplot of G3 by Freetime')
    plt.xlabel('Freetime')
    plt.ylabel('G3')
    plt.show()
    ```


#### Task 4

We can explore the effect of alcohol consumption on academic performance.



```python
response = agent.invoke("Generate scatter plots to examine the correlation between 'Dalc' (daily alcohol consumption) and 'G3', and between 'Walc' (weekend alcohol consumption) and 'G3'.")
```


    
![png](output_63_0.png)
    


Execute the code below to retrieve the Python script the LLM used for plotting.



```python
print(response['intermediate_steps'][-1][0].tool_input.replace('; ', '\n'))
```

    ```python
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import pandas as pd
    
    # Assuming df is the DataFrame
    plt.figure(figsize=(10,5))
    
    plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
    plt.scatter(df['Dalc'], df['G3'])
    plt.title('Dalc vs G3')
    plt.xlabel('Dalc')
    plt.ylabel('G3')
    
    plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
    plt.scatter(df['Walc'], df['G3'])
    plt.title('Walc vs G3')
    plt.xlabel('Walc')
    plt.ylabel('G3')
    
    plt.tight_layout()
    plt.show()
    ```

### Exercise 3 - Explore LLM's code


Can you find what code the model used to generate the plot for exploring the relationship between absences and academic performance?

You could run the corresponding code and from the response chain, you could see the code used from charting.



```python
# your code here
```


```python
response = agent.invoke("Plot a scatter plot showing the correlation between the number of absences ('absences') and final grades ('G3') of students.")

for i in range(len(response['intermediate_steps'])):
    print(response['intermediate_steps'][i][0].tool_input.replace(';', '\n'))
```

    ```python
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    plt.figure(figsize=(10,6))
    plt.scatter(df['absences'], df['G3'])
    plt.xlabel('Number of Absences')
    plt.ylabel('Final Grades')
    plt.title('Correlation between Absences and Final Grades')
    plt.show()
